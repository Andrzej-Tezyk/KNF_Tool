# How to run a project:

1) create .env file with your Gemini API in the root
2) run rag_setup_db_async.py to setup vector database (may take around 20 min)



# Git
- always use squash (one commit instead of entire history)
- rebase or merge does not matter
- however, when many commits behind main, would recommend to use it and solve conflicts before merging

### Branch naming
Use this guide:
https://conventional-branch.github.io/

### PR
- add description
- after creating pr: on the left side of GitHub interface, use Development option to add a related kanban ticket
- request and wait for review (can be done using GitHub interface -> also on the left)
